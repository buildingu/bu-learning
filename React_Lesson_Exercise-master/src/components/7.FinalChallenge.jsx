/**
 * Challenge 7: Final
 *
 * Description:
 * Create a form with fields for first name, last name, age, and phone number. Use state, refs, and any other React hooks of your choice to 
 * manage form data, validation, and real-time feedback. Incorporate how ever many hooks you want!
 *
 * Validation:
 * Display validation messages under each input if the input is invalid using useState and the error message should clear for the specific 
 * field one if the user types in the field.
 * 
 * - All fields are required.
 * - `First name` and `last name` fields should have a max character count of 120.
 * - The `age` field must:
 *    1. Must be a number
 *    2. Have max character count of 3.
 *    3. Greater than 18.
 * - The `phone` field must be a number and a have max character count of 3.
 *    1. Must be a number
 *    2. Character count equals 10 (e.g., 5048073240).
 * 
 * Lastly, clear the form if validation passes and render a success message.
