This project is for the Building-U (bu-learning) Learning Session aimed at interns. It provides an opportunity for interns to learn and develop their skills in a collaborative environment.

Project Overview
The Building-U Learning Session project is designed to offer interns a practical learning experience. Throughout the session, interns will work on various tasks and assignments related to a specific project or set of projects.

Workflow and Submission
To ensure a structured workflow, interns are required to follow these guidelines:

Branches: Each intern will have their own branch dedicated to their work, allowing for easy management of individual contributions.

Task Assignment: Interns will be assigned specific tasks or projects to work on during the learning session. Task assignments will be communicated through the project management system or other means of coordination.

Development: Interns should clone the repository and create a local copy of their respective branch. They can then start working on the assigned tasks, making changes, and implementing new features.

Commit and Push: Interns should commit their work frequently, providing meaningful commit messages that clearly explain the changes made. After committing, they should push their changes to their respective branches on the remote repository.

Collaboration and Communication
Interns are encouraged to actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and seek guidance from mentors or fellow interns throughout the learning session. Collaborative tools, such as project management systems, communication channels, or regular meetings, will be utilized to facilitate effective communication and teamwork.

Getting Started
To get started with the Building-U Learning Session project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository_url>

Create a branch with your name or assigned identifier: git checkout -b <branch_name>

Begin working on the assigned tasks or projects.
