      Student Council Project Term 3: Cultures and Cuisines Celebration Our focus this term is to share elements of our culture that mean something to us. 
      We are proud and privileged to be part of a truly global community. We think it is important to recognise, share and respect one another's cultures. 
      Those of us on the school council felt food, in particular, was an important part of our home lives and cultures!! We know there will be other customs, traditions and celebrations that are important to you too. 
      Submit by the 9th July and the winners will be featured in our next newsletter as well as win prizes (tbc)
      You could send us: 
      - Recipes 
      - Festival posters 
      - Pictures of special food dishes 
      - A video of preparations or festival activities 
      - A picture of your in traditional or celebratory costume or anything else you can think of! </p>
