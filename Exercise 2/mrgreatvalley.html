    <h4>What is Mr. Great Valley?</h4>
    <p>Mr. Great Valley is an event organized by GVHS' student council officers. Every year, around 5-6
        students (open to all genders now) choose to showcase their talents through singing, dancing, and other acts 
        to a panel of judges (GVHS teachers). There are multiple rounds including the performance and trivia about
        Great Valley. The winner is selected based on their overall performance at the event!

    <h4>What is the purpose of Mr. Great Valley?</h4>
    <p>The goal of the event is to
        raise money for the Crisi Character Award, a scholarship in honor of former social studies teacher of
        35 years, Mr. Crisi, who unfortunately passed away from lymphoma in 2006. The scholarship awards 
        $1000 to one senior girl and boy who show outstanding character qualities in academics, athletics,
