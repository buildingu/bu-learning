    <h1>Mr. Great Valley</h1>
    <h3>Friday, March 1st 7-9pm</h3>

    <h4>What is Mr. Great Valley?</h4>
    <p>Mr. Great Valley is an event organized by GVHS' student council officers. Every year, around 5-6
        students (open to all genders now) choose to showcase their talents through singing, dancing, and other acts 
        to a panel of judges (GVHS teachers). There are multiple rounds including the performance and trivia about
        Great Valley. The winner is selected based on their overall performance at the event! All Great Valley community
        members are invited to attend!
    </p>
    <h4>What is the purpose of Mr. Great Valley?</h4>
    <p>The goal of the event is to
        raise money for the Crisi Character Award, a scholarship in honor of former social studies teacher of
        35 years, Mr. Crisi, who unfortunately passed away from lymphoma in 2006. The scholarship awards 
        $1000 to one senior girl and boy who show outstanding character qualities in academics, athletics,
        and activities.
